# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and displays "hello world" on the screen.

This project has been updated to include CSS styling. The `src/App.css` file is now imported in `src/App.tsx` to apply styles to the application. The inline styles in `src/App.tsx` have been moved to `src/App.css` and applied to the `.hello-world` class. The `id` attribute has been replaced with `className`.
